# Mintlify Landing Page Clone (HTML & CSS)

This repository contains a detailed front-end recreation of the **Mintlify official landing page** using **pure HTML and CSS**.  
The goal of this project is to closely replicate the original UI/UX, including layout structure, typography, spacing, colors, and component hierarchy, while keeping the codebase clean, readable, and beginner-friendly.

This project was built as a **frontend practice + UI cloning assignment**, focusing on real-world design accuracy and modern layout techniques.
